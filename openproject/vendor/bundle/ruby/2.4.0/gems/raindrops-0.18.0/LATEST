=== raindrops 0.18.0 / 2017-03-23 02:44 UTC

  The most notable feature of this release is the addition of
  FreeBSD and OpenBSD TCP_INFO support.  This includes the
  Raindrops::TCP for portably mapping TCP state names to
  platform-dependent numeric values:

  Thanks to Jeremy Evans and Simon Eskildsen on the
  unicorn-public@bogomips.org mailing list for inspiring
  these changes to raindrops.

  There's also a few internal cleanups, and documentation
  improvements, including some fixes to the largely-forgotten
  Raindrops::Aggreage::PMQ class:
